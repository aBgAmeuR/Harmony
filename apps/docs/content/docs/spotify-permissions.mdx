# Spotify Account Permissions

When you sign in with Spotify, Harmony requests a small set of **OAuth scopes** that allow us to read your listening activity. We request **read-only** access. Harmony never modifies your library or playback.

<Callout variant="warning">Harmony will **never** post, follow, or modify anything in your Spotify account. All permissions are strictly for reading data necessary for analytics.</Callout>

## Scope Breakdown

| Scope | Why Harmony Needs It | Data Collected | Storage Duration |
|-------|----------------------|----------------|------------------|
| `user-read-email` | Verifies your Spotify account and links it to a local user record. | Email address | Until you delete your account |
| `user-top-read` | Fetches your top artists and tracks for weekly “Top” charts. | Top 50 artists & tracks (short-, medium-, long-term) | 2 years rolling window |
| `user-read-recently-played` | Populates the **Recently Played** section | Last 50 played tracks | Never |

## How We Use Your Data

1. **Top-50 Rankings** : We calculate weekly positions for your Top 50 artists and tracks to show how your favourites rise or fall over time.
2. **Recently Played Insights** : We display your 50 most recent tracks to highlight what you’ve been listening to lately.
3. **Deletion on Request** : Remove your account in **Settings → Danger Zone** to wipe all records within 24 hours.

## Revoking Access

You may revoke Harmony’s access at any moment:

1. Visit [https://www.spotify.com/account/apps/](https://www.spotify.com/account/apps/)
2. Locate “Harmony” and click **Remove Access**
3. Sign out of Harmony, the app will stop fetching new data.
