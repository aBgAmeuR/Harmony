# How It Works

Harmony lets you create **secure, time-limited URLs** so friends can view your music profile without signing up. This page explains the mechanics, security considerations, and day-to-day workflows.

<Callout type="warn">You can manage up to <strong>10 active links</strong> at any given time. Older links must be revoked before creating new ones.</Callout>

## Generating a Link

1. Navigate to **Settings → Sharing**.
2. Click **New Share Link**.
3. Choose:
   • **Expiration Date** - when the link stops working (default: 7 days).  
   • **Usage Limit** - total number of visits allowed (default: unlimited).  
4. Press **Generate**.

Harmony will generate a link like this:

```text
https://harmony.antoinejosset.fr/profile/54cf4c16-8a22-4ee2-844c-de903e0c6d61
```

## Security

When you create a link, Harmony simply stores **the link ID plus your user ID**.

When someone clicks the link:

1. They are signed in automatically as a special **Demo user** that is internally mapped to *your* user ID.  
2. The visitor can browse your charts exactly as you see them, but **all write actions are disabled** (no settings, no package imports).  

In short, guests get a read-only snapshot of your profile, and you keep full control via the link dashboard.

## Best Practices

• Create separate links for each recipient for granular control.  
• Use short expiry windows for public posts.  
• Revoke links as soon as they are no longer needed.
