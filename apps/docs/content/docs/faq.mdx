## General

### What is Harmony?
Harmony is an open-source music analytics platform that ingests your Spotify listening data and presents rich insights via an elegant web interface.

### Is it free?
Yes. Harmony is licensed under GPL-3.0 and free for personal and commercial use. Self-hosting costs (server, database) are your responsibility.

### Which browsers are supported?
All latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge are supported.

### Can I use Harmony if I don't have a Spotify Premium account?
Yes. Harmony works seamlessly with both Spotify **Free** and **Premium** accounts, there are no feature restrictions based on your subscription.

## Usage

### Why are some charts empty?
Currently, a background **cron job** runs at the beginning of each week and back-fills data for *two* of the headline charts. The remaining visualisations rely on either:

1. **Package uploads** - make sure you have imported your latest listening archive via the **Package Upload** page.
2. **Sufficient history** - some stats require several weeks of data before trends appear.

If your charts are still blank after a week and you have uploaded the package, open an issue.

### How often is my data updated?
Harmony automatically refreshes data from the Spotify Web API **every hour** for the **Top Artists**, **Top Tracks**, and **Recently Played** sections. For richer metrics—such as long-term rankings and historical charts—you can upload your Spotify data package **once per day**.

### How do I share my profile securely?
Use the **Share Link** feature. Links contain signed, time-limited JWTs. You can revoke links at any time from **Settings → Sharing**.

## Data & Privacy

### What scopes does Harmony request from Spotify?
See [Spotify Account Permissions](/docs/spotify-permissions) for the full list and rationale.

### Where is my data stored?
Your listening history live inside a **secure, central PostgreSQL database** managed by Harmony. No third-party analytics services receive your data, the only external system involved is the database itself.

## Troubleshooting Cheat-Sheet

| Symptom | Quick Fix |
|---------|-----------|
| `500 Internal Server Error` on `/api/upload` | Ensure `UPLOADTHING_TOKEN` is set and the token is valid. |
| Migration fails with `relation "_drizzle_migrations" does not exist` | Run `pnpm db:generate && pnpm db:push` inside `apps/studio`. |
| Images not loading | Verify your CDN or reverse proxy is serving `/public` correctly. |
| `401 Unauthorized` on `/api/auth/callback/spotify` | Ensure `AUTH_URL` in `.env` matches your frontend URL. |
