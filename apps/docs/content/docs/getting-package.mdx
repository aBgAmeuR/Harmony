# Getting & Importing the Spotify Package

Harmony’s advanced statistics (e.g. year-over-year trends, forgotten gems, historical rankings) require data that the public Spotify API does **not** expose. You can supply this information yourself by uploading the **Extended Streaming History** package Spotify provides on request.

<Callout>The import feature is optional, Harmony still works without it, but you’ll unlock richer insights once the package is uploaded.</Callout>

## Requesting Your Package

1. Open the [Spotify Privacy page](https://www.spotify.com/account/privacy/) on the Spotify website.
2. Scroll to **Download your data** and edit the "Download your data" section as on the image:

3. Click **Request data**.

4. **Confirm your request via email.**  
   After clicking "Request data," Spotify will send you a confirmation email. Open the email and follow the instructions to confirm your data request.

5. **Wait for your data to be prepared.**  
   Spotify will process your request, this can take up to 30 days, but it often arrives sooner. You’ll receive another email when your archive is ready for download.

6. **Download your Spotify data ZIP file.**  
   The email will include a download link, usually for a file named `my_spotify_data.zip`. **Do not unzip or rename its internal files**, Harmony requires the original ZIP format for import.

<Callout type="warn">The download link from Spotify expires after 14 days. Be sure to save the ZIP file locally until you’ve imported it into Harmony.</Callout>

## Uploading to Harmony

1. Open **Package** in the sidebar.
2. Click **Choose file** and select the ZIP you downloaded.
3. Harmony validates the structure and queues the archive for processing.
4. You’ll receive a toast when the import is complete (usually < 1 min).

### What Gets Imported?

We import all JSON files inside the ZIP that match the pattern `Streaming_History_Audio_*.json`.

## Re-Uploading New Data

When you upload a new package, Harmony will first remove your previous archive and then import all tracks from the new ZIP.

## Troubleshooting

There are several types of data packages Spotify may provide, but **only the "Extended streaming history data" package contains the correct files for importing into Harmony**. The other packages are not eligible for import.

| Type of data                    | Description                                         | Data preparation time         |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Account data                     | Basic account info, one year of streaming data      | ~ 5 days                     |
| Technical log information        | Technical logs Spotify has collected about you      | Up to 30 days                |
| Extended streaming history data  | Lifetime streaming history information              | Up to 30 days (avg. 2–3 weeks) |

<Callout type="warn">
Only the <b>Extended streaming history data</b> package includes the correct files to import to Harmony. If you received a different package, it cannot be imported. We recommend checking the email from Spotify to ensure you have the correct package before uploading.
</Callout>

| Issue                        | Fix |
|------------------------------|-----|
| "Invalid package structure"   | Make sure you selected the <b>ZIP</b> file you received from Spotify, not an extracted folder. Only the Extended streaming history data ZIP is supported. If you uploaded a different package, please request the correct one from Spotify. |
| Import stuck at 0&nbsp;%      | Reload the page and try again. If the issue persists, create an issue on the [GitHub](https://github.com/aBgAmeuR/harmony/issues/new). |
| Tracks show as "Unknown"      | Wait for the nightly metadata sync; Harmony back-fills missing IDs. |

<Callout>Once imported, refresh your dashboard to explore new historical insights!</Callout>
