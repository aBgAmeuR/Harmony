# Computation Methods Explained

Harmony offers **three ways** to rank your tracks, artists, and albums. Each method serves a different purpose depending on the insights you’re after. The table below gives a high-level comparison before we dive deeper.

| Method | Data Source | Accuracy | Time Range Support | List Length |
|--------|------------|----------|--------------------|-------------|
| Machine-Learning (Spotify) | Spotify Top API | ⭐️ | 3 presets (4w, 6m, 1y) | ≤ 50 |
| Play Count | Streaming-history package | ⭐️⭐️ | Any (custom) | Unlimited |
| Time Played | Streaming-history package | ⭐️⭐️ | Any (custom) | Unlimited |
| Custom (SOON) | Streaming-history package | ⭐️⭐️⭐️ | Any (custom) | Unlimited |

<Callout variant="info">Tip: Uploading your <b>Extended streaming history</b> unlocks the Play Count and Time Played methods.</Callout>

## 1. Machine-Learning (Spotify API)

Spotify’s Web API returns a list it calls “Top Artists/Tracks” which is generated by proprietary models. The exact recipe is not public, but factors likely include:

* Total play time per item
* Skip rate
* Recency (when you listened)
* Historical presence in previous lists

### Formula (conceptual)

```math
\text{score} = w_1 \cdot \text{play\_time} + w_2 \cdot (1 - \text{skip\_rate}) + w_3 \cdot \text{recency} + w_4 \cdot \text{streak}
```

where the *w* coefficients are internal to Spotify.

### Pros & Cons

| ✔ Advantages | ✖ Limitations |
|--------------|--------------|
| Works out-of-the-box | Only 3 fixed ranges (4 weeks, 6 months, 1 year) |
| No data import required | Capped at 50 items |
| - | Inaccurate for niche content |

---

## 2. Play Count

This method orders items purely by the **number of times** you played them.

### Formula

```math
\text{score} = \text{total\_plays}
```

If you filter by date range, we count only plays whose timestamp lies within the window.

### Example

Imagine two tracks over the last year:

| Track | Plays |
|-------|-------|
| Song A | 120 |
| Song B | 95 |

Play-count ranking → **Song A** #1, **Song B** #2.

### Pros & Cons

| ✔ | ✖ |
|---|---|
| Extremely accurate | Requires package import |
| Custom time ranges | - |
| Faster than API (local DB query) | - |

---

## 3. Time Played

Here we rank by **milliseconds listened** rather than count. Longer tracks (podcasts, DJ mixes) get fair representation.

### Formula

```math
\text{score} = \sum \text{listen\_duration\_ms}
```

### Example

| Track | Plays | Avg. Length | Time Played |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Symphony (10 min) | 20 | 600 000 ms | 12 000 000 ms |
| Pop Hit (3 min) | 40 | 180 000 ms | 7 200 000 ms |

Despite fewer plays, **Symphony** outranks **Pop Hit** because total listening time is higher.

### Pros & Cons

| ✔ | ✖ |
|---|---|
| Accurate & bias-free | Requires package import |
| Rewards long-form content | - |
| Custom time ranges | - |

## Choosing a Method

* Casual glance → **Machine-Learning** is fine.
* Precise stats & deep dives → **Play Count** or **Time Played**.
* Long DJ sets, podcasts → **Time Played** gives the fairest ranking.

You can switch methods from the **Sort** dropdown on the settings page (SOON).
